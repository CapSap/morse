# Morse Code Keyer

## Project Description

This is a simple morse code encoder/decoder single page app built in react.

## How to run

You should be able to visit [this link to live site](https://radiant-headland-90509.herokuapp.com/)
or you can pull the project, npm i && npm start.

## MVP

- Must support the alphabet, spaces, numbers
- Must give user feedback when they input unsupported characters
- Must be able to translate both ways
- Project must use javascript modules to seperate dom logic from vanilla js logic
- Can use react, or vanilla js.
- Functions you write must be unit tested (you won't be able to write unit tests for function that interact with the dom)
- Include a readme

## Thoughts

When first starting out I wanted to keep the MorseInput / InputContainer modular a modular container that I could pass functionality to. I had some trouble passing a function as props to this component that had a setState function inside.
This app works by:

Updating the state of component on every input / change to the text area. Within this component there is a function that runs on every render to check any invalid inputs. On invalid input, the user will be alerted and the last character will be removed from state.

On button press, a function is called that encodes or decodes english input. The result of this function is rendered.

### For next time

I think I should have added a clear button to clear all inputs and reset for user and make everything bigger.

It would be good to remove that function from the component so that the component is modular and functionality is handed to it.
